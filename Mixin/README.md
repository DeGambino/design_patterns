The example is a `Person` class that:

* represents a basic person with a name and age.
* uses a mixin to add the functionality of a `CanDrive` ability, allowing objects to gain this ability without inheriting directly.

### What is the Mixin Pattern?

The **Mixin Pattern** is a design pattern used to add reusable behavior or functionality to classes without using inheritance. Instead of inheriting from a single parent class, a class can "mix in" various methods or properties from other sources. Mixins provide a way to achieve reusable, shareable functionality across multiple classes. 

* It allows you to mix in properties and methods from one object into another, augmenting the target object without deep inheritance chains.

* It promotes composition over inheritance, allowing different types of behaviors to be shared and combined across classes.

* The Mixin Pattern enables more flexible and reusable code, as classes can share common functionality without being tightly coupled or forming hierarchical structures.

#### **When to use the Mixin Pattern?**

* When you need to share behavior or functionality between classes without introducing a complex inheritance hierarchy.

* When you want to reuse functionality but prefer composition over inheritance to avoid the pitfalls of deep inheritance chains.

* In scenarios where different objects or classes should share behavior but don't necessarily have a parent-child relationship.
