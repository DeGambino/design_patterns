The example is a `greetings` module that:

* exports `sayMorning`, `sayAfternoon`, and `sayEvening` functions to provide different greetings.

* is statically imported into another module using the import statement.

#### What is Static Import?

Static Import allows you to import functions, classes, or constants from other modules in JavaScript using the import statement. This approach helps you load code in a structured and modular way. Static imports are evaluated at compile time, making them more predictable and suitable for optimizations. 

* They make module dependencies explicit by importing only what is needed, helping in keeping the codebase clean.

* Static imports are resolved at the top of the module, ensuring that all dependencies are available when the script is executed.

* It allows for partial imports, meaning you can import only specific functions or objects from a module, helping with performance and reducing unnecessary code in the bundle.

 #### When to use Static Import?
 
* When you want to use functionality from other modules in a clean, maintainable, and optimized way.

* When you need a modular structure where each module exposes only what is needed, and consumers of the module only import the parts they need.

* In scenarios where you want to ensure that all dependencies are loaded upfront and can be statically analyzed for performance optimization.
