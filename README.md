# Design Patterns



## Creational

Creational design patterns are used to design the instantiation process of objects. The creational pattern uses inheritance to vary the object creation.

1. [Builder](#builder)
2. [Prototype](#prototype)
3. [Factory](#factory)
4. [Abstract Factory](#abstract-factory)
5. [Singleton](#singleton)

## Structural

1. [Adapter](#adapter)
2. [Composite](#composite)
3. [Proxy](#proxy)
4. [Bridge](#bridge)
5. [Decorator](#decorator)
6. [Flyweight](#flyweight)
7. [Facade](#facade)
