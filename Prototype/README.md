The example is a `Car` class that:

* has a `clone` method that allows creating new objects based on an existing instance.

* uses the `Object.create` method to clone an object, maintaining the original object's properties and methods.

### What is the Prototype Pattern?

The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows an object to be cloned, creating new instances based on an existing object. Instead of instantiating objects from scratch, it enables copying or cloning an existing object, which serves as a prototype. 

* It allows for creating new objects by copying an existing instance, rather than creating a new instance through the constructor.

* The `clone` method or `Object.create` is commonly used in JavaScript to implement this pattern.

This pattern can be used to avoid the overhead of creating objects from scratch or when an object creation is expensive in terms of time or resources.

Prototypes in JavaScript are an intrinsic feature of the language, with each object having an internal `[[Prototype]]` reference to another object.

#### When to use the Prototype Pattern?

* When object creation is costly in terms of time or resources, and you need to create multiple instances that share some configuration or state.

* When you want to avoid creating instances using constructors and prefer cloning an existing object.

* In scenarios where you need to clone complex objects that are initialized once but need to be used multiple times.
