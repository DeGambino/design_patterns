## What is the Flyweight Pattern?

**The Flyweight Pattern helps reduce memory usage by sharing common data between many similar objects. Instead of storing duplicate data in each object, it separates the objectâ€™s state into shared (intrinsic) and unique (extrinsic) parts. The shared data is reused, minimizing memory consumption.** 

* This pattern is especially useful when you have a large number of objects that share similar data.

### You should use the Flyweight Pattern when:

* You're creating many similar objects, and memory usage becomes an issue.
* The objects share a lot of common data that can be reused.
* You need to improve performance, such as in graphical applications (rendering many shapes) or managing large sets of similar data.


**The example is a `ShapeFactory` that:**

* manages the creation of different `Shape` objects, such as `Circle`, using a flyweight mechanism.

* stores and reuses existing objects (flyweights) to minimize memory usage when many similar objects need to be created.
