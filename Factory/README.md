The example is a `VehicleFactory` that:

* creates different types of vehicles (e.g., Car, Truck) based on a specified type.

* encapsulates the object creation process, allowing the client to request an object without knowing the specific class or how it is created.

### What is the Factory Pattern?

The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Instead of creating objects directly using a constructor, the Factory Pattern defines a method that is used to create objects, promoting loose coupling and making the code more flexible and scalable. 

* It encapsulates object creation, separating it from the client, so the exact class of the object can change without affecting the client code.

* It promotes loose coupling by adhering to the Open-Closed Principle (the class is open for extension but closed for modification).

* It is commonly used in scenarios where the exact type of the object to be created is determined dynamically at runtime.

#### When to use the Factory Pattern?

* When the exact class of the object to be created is determined at runtime.

* When the object creation logic is complex and needs to be abstracted from the client.

* In scenarios where you want to delegate the responsibility of object creation to a central place, following the Single Responsibility Principle.
