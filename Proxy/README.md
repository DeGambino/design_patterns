The example is a `User` object that:

* has a `name` and age property.
* is accessed through a `UserProxy`, which adds validation to the `set` method (e.g., ensuring that the `age` is a valid number and name is a string).

### What is the Proxy Pattern?

The Proxy pattern provides an intermediary object that controls access to another object. This can be used to add functionality such as validation, logging, or lazy initialization, without modifying the original object. Some key points about the Proxy pattern:

* The Proxy object intercepts operations on the target object, such as getting or setting properties.

* The `get` and `set` methods are commonly overridden to manage property access and mutation.

* `Reflect` is a built-in object often used in Proxy implementations to delegate operations back to the original target object.

* Common use cases include input validation, logging, lazy loading, or access control.

#### When to use the Proxy Pattern?

* When you need to control or validate access to an objectâ€™s properties.

* When you want to transparently introduce additional behavior, such as logging or input validation, without modifying the original object.

* In scenarios where resource-heavy objects need to be initialized only when necessary (lazy initialization).
