## What is the Provider Pattern?

**The Provider Pattern is used to manage and provide shared resources like data, configurations, or services to different parts of a system without tightly coupling them to the resource's implementation. It acts as a central source that distributes these resources, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.** 

* In frameworks like React, the Provider Pattern is commonly used to manage state, services, or configurations across components using context.

### You should use the Provider Pattern when:

* YMultiple components or modules need access to shared resources like state, data, or services.
* You want to centralize the distribution of resources, ensuring that each part of the system only gets what it needs.
* You need a centralized way to handle services such as theming, localization, authentication, or data fetching.


**The example is a `ThemeProvider` class that:**

* manages different themes (e.g., light mode and dark mode) for an application.

* provides the current theme to components, allowing them to render according to the active theme.
