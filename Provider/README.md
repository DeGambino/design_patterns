The example is a `ThemeProvider` class that:

* manages different themes (e.g., light mode and dark mode) for an application.

* provides the current theme to components, allowing them to render according to the active theme.

### What is the Provider Pattern?

The Provider Pattern is a design pattern commonly used to decouple the logic of providing resources (like data, configurations, or services) from the components that consume them. This pattern centralizes and manages access to shared resources or states, allowing other parts of the system to access these resources without needing to directly interact with the resourceâ€™s implementation. Some key points about the Provider Pattern:

* It acts as a central source of truth, managing and distributing shared resources or services.

* It decouples the consumers from the logic of managing these resources, allowing for cleaner and more maintainable code.

* It is often used in frameworks like React, where the context and Provider component can manage state, services, or other resources across a tree of components.

#### When to use the Provider Pattern?
* When you have a shared resource or service (like state, configurations, or data) that multiple components or modules need to access.

* When you want to manage the distribution of resources centrally and ensure that consumers only receive what they need.

* In scenarios where you need to centralize logic for handling services such as theming, localization, authentication, or data fetching.
