The example is a `ChatRoomMediator` that:

* facilitates communication between different User objects in a chat room.

* decouples the communication logic between users, allowing them to send messages through the mediator instead of directly interacting with each other.

### What is the Mediator/Middleware Pattern?
The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an object (the mediator) to encapsulate how a set of objects interact with each other. Instead of objects communicating directly, they interact through a mediator, reducing the dependencies between them. This allows for decoupled communication and improved control over interactions. 

* It centralizes communication between objects, reducing the number of direct connections and dependencies between them.

* The mediator controls the flow of communication, enabling more flexible and maintainable interaction logic.

* It simplifies communication between multiple objects, especially when their interactions are complex or change frequently.

#### **When to use the Mediator Pattern?**
* When you have multiple objects that need to communicate with each other, but you want to reduce dependencies and direct connections between them.

* When the communication logic between objects becomes too complex and needs to be centralized in one place.

* In scenarios where objects are tightly coupled through many-to-many relationships, and you need to promote loose coupling for easier maintenance and scalability.
