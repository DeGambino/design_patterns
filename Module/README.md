The example is a `ShoppingCartModule` that:

* maintains a list of items in the cart (in private scope).
* exposes public methods to add items, remove items, and view the cartâ€™s contents.


### What is the Module Pattern?

The Module Pattern is a design pattern used to encapsulate private data and functions within a closure, while exposing only the desired interface (public methods). It helps organize code in a way that prevents pollution of the global scope and provides controlled access to specific variables or functions. 

* It allows for the creation of private variables and methods that are inaccessible from outside the module.

* It exposes an API that provides access to only the parts of the module that should be public.

* This pattern promotes the idea of information hiding and improves code organization by keeping related functionality within a single unit.

#### When to use the Module Pattern?
* When you want to encapsulate private data or functions and only expose a controlled, limited interface to interact with the module.

* When you want to avoid polluting the global scope, especially in environments where many variables and functions might conflict.

* In scenarios where different parts of the code should not directly access certain internal details but still need to interact with specific functionality.
